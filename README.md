Apothesis is a open source software for simulating deposition processes via the kinetic Monte Carlo method. 
This is the first step for creating a generalized kinetic Monte Carlo code 
for surface growth phenomena targeting chemical vapor and atomic layer deposition processes.  

It is still under development but please be free to contact me if something is on your mind!
